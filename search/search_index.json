If our learning objective is \"apply critical thinking\" and the LLM estimates several years are needed to master the learning objective, the training developers may want to reconsider whether the course is intended to take several years.

The cognitive differences between a novice and an expert are not merely quantitative (i.e., the expert knows more); they are qualitative, reflecting fundamental shifts in how knowledge is structured, accessed, and applied. Understanding these shifts is important for designing and evaluating learning objectives that are appropriately rigorous at each stage.</p> <p>Academic education makes this distinction through the concepts of elementary school, middle school, high school, and increasingly 'rigorous' college degrees from associates, bachelors, masters, and finally doctoral degrees. A learning objective appropriately cognitively rigorous for a 3rd grader would not be appropriate for college graduate students. Likewise, asking the 3rd grader to write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation is unrealistic. Vocational training follows a similar trend with tiered levels of competency given different names such as Basic, Senior, and Master qualification levels.</p> Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Infographic by HelpfulProfessor.com <p>The \"Related links\" section of this page includes more information on Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning. The general idea is learning objectives at the novice/basic level should best match the cognitive rigor described in the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: remember and apply. Can the basic learner simply recall and understand facts they are given? As a learner establishes proficiency and moves towards mastery, the learning objectives they're asked to complete should \"move up\" Bloom's Taxonomy ending with tasks asking the learner to create fundamentally new ideas and things.</p> <p>As with time estimates, either human experts, an LLM AI, or both working together can be used to create initial estimates of which level of Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning a particular learning objective most relates to. If a learning objective in a course designed for basic learners is assessed as being very high in Bloom's Taxonomy (evaluate, create), the course developer may want to reconsider whether it is appropriate for that level of learners. A \"remember\" or \"understand\" aligned learning objective in a qualification intended for experts may also not be appropriate as it's unlikely to be a good use of the time set aside for them to learn new things.</p>","tags":["Training","Bloom's Taxonomy"]},{"location":"2025/12/03/training-rigor/#bringing-it-all-together-curriculum-and-qualification-design","title":"Bringing it all Together: Curriculum and Qualification Design","text":"<p>Once estimates for the logistical and cognitive rigor for each learning objective in a course or qualification are complete, it's possible for the training developers to assess whether their training program appropriately assists learning in progressing from basic, senior, and finally master/expert mastery of a topic. The majority of learning objectives given to basic/novice learners should be \"lower\" in Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning: Remember, Understand, and Apply. Master/expert learners should be asked to focus on more abstract tasks: create, evaluate, and analyze. Senior or intermediate learners should be asked to take on learning goals that begin to transition recalling facts identified by others and develop their own original but well considered ideas: apply and analyze learning objectives.</p> <p>Additionally, it's important to identify and eliminate unnecessary logistic rigor. Let's return to the earlier example of the learning objective \"apply critical thinking\" with an LLM AI estimating several years to complete. Its important that curriculum developers select learning objectives that are appropriately specific and don't impose an excessive time commitment from students. Learning objectives with high time estimates should probably be eliminated or rewritten regardless of whether their cognitive rigor is appropriate for the learner's level of expertise.</p>","tags":["Training","Bloom's Taxonomy"]},{"location":"2025/12/03/training-rigor/#visualizing-rigor-estimates","title":"Visualizing Rigor Estimates","text":"<p>Once curriculum develops understand how to 'read' violin plots of the estimated completion time and Bloom's Taxonomy level for each learning objective (aka Knowledge, Skill, or Ability) developed in their course or qualification, they can quickly assess whether they've appropriately created a series of increasingly difficult tiers of learning.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In the example above, we can make a couple key observations about whether the curriculum is well designed:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Most learning objectives (KSAs) are less than a couple of days.
